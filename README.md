# Linear Regression Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building and evaluating a linear regression model to analyze and predict customer spending behavior using the **Ecommerce Customers dataset**. The goal is to understand the relationship between various customer-related features and their yearly expenditure.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is **"Ecommerce Customers.csv"**, which contains information about customers and their purchasing behavior. Below are the columns in the dataset:

- **Email**: The email address of the customer (used as an identifier).
- **Address**: The physical address of the customer.
- **Avatar**: The avatar style associated with the customer.
- **Avg. Session Length**: Average session length on the website (in minutes).
- **Time on App**: Average time spent on the mobile app (in minutes).
- **Time on Website**: Average time spent on the website (in minutes).
- **Length of Membership**: The duration of membership with the platform (in years).
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: Total spending by the customer in a year (target variable).

## Notebook Contents
The Jupyter Notebook, **"linear regression project.ipynb"**, includes the following sections:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Import the dataset using pandas.
   - Display the structure and summary of the data.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing or irrelevant data (if any).
   - Feature selection and preparation for modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize relationships between features using tools like matplotlib.
   - Analyze correlations and distributions to identify significant predictors of the target variable.

4. **Model Building**
   - Implement a linear regression model from scratch using numpy.
   - Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

5. **Results and Insights**
   - Interpret the model’s coefficients to understand feature importance.
   - Present key findings and actionable insights based on the results.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib

   Install them using pip if necessary:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. **Download Files**:
   - Place the **"linear regression project.ipynb"** notebook and **"Ecommerce Customers.csv"** dataset in the same directory.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm).
   - Execute the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Results and Insights
- The model identifies key predictors of yearly expenditure, such as **Length of Membership** and **Time on App**.
- Coefficient analysis provides actionable insights for improving customer engagement and maximizing revenue.
- Evaluation metrics indicate the model’s accuracy and potential areas for improvement.

## Future Enhancements
- Explore more complex models like polynomial regression or machine learning algorithms.
- Perform feature engineering to derive new variables that could improve model performance.
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
